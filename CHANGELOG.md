# symbols Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]

### Fixed

- Folder color icons now render correctly for named folders (`src`, `test`, `tests`, `docs`, `components`, `pages`, `styles`, `scripts`, `types`, `dist`, `.github`, `.git`, `node_modules`, and 140+ more). The generator was reading icon definition keys instead of `folderNames` from the theme, so color-coded folders were silently ignored.
- Fixed `biome.svg` and `swc.svg` rendering at 48px instead of 16px due to missing `width`/`height` attributes on their root `<svg>` element.
- Icon generator (`generate.ts`) now injects `width="16" height="16"` on any SVG that lacks those attributes entirely, not only SVGs that already have them with a different value.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-08
